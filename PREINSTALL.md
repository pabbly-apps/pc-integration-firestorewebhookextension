| `UPDATE_COLLECTION_PATH`   | Firestore path to monitor for updates.                                      | ‚ùå       | `orders/{orderId}`                            |

## üîç Important Considerations

- The extension requires your **Pabbly Connect Webhook URL** to accept HTTP POST requests with JSON payloads.
- Make sure the Firestore collections you want to monitor exist or will be created.
- The extension will incur Firebase Cloud Function and Firestore usage costs based on your activity.
- Ensure you understand your Firestore security rules, as this extension listens to document changes.

---

## üìã Installation Tips

- Double-check your `WEBHOOK_URL` for correctness before installation.
- If you want to monitor multiple collections or specific paths, use Firestore path wildcards like `{collectionId}/{documentId}`.
- Choose the correct `LOCATION` closest to your Firestore data to reduce latency and costs.
